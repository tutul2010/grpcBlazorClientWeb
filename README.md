**have u see that a huge amout of data are loading to a UI browser (10K count of rows  records data)** -- *NO* , It is not possible to handle  huge amount of data at web applicatuon or *http/tcp or werbshoket* protocole</br>
Normally, For loading a huge amount data at UI web app, We used to follow below tricks as.. </br>
*1) trying pagination concept at store procedure(db level) for retuning huge data as chunks by chunks to web client-</br>*
*2) trying do pagination logic at API/ UI app and used to do cashing mechanism for most viewable page's data at web client -</br>*
*3) trying do batch kind processing in background app and used to load or pushing data to UI app or storage - </br>*
If you are loading below azure histed website and try to load huge amount(click at 'Fetch data 10k') data at Browser-chrorme and Thanks to  #msft for grpc-web framework </br>
for increasing request /response msg sizing of web or many others feature like web streaming . Above UI page is taking  time(2/4 minutes) to load 10k counts of rows data.</br>
